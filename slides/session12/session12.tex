\begin{frame}{Model Dimensions (1/2)}
	\vspace{20pt}
	
	The TDWI BI \& AI maturity model is built on five core dimensions that reflect 
	critical aspects of data and analytics management.  
	Each serves as a lens to evaluate strengths and weaknesses on the journey to becoming data-driven.
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Organizational Maturity:} Covers strategy, leadership, culture, and resources. 
		Early stages often lack executive sponsorship and alignment, while mature organizations 
		foster strong leadership, cross-functional collaboration, and a pervasive data-driven culture.
		
		\item \textbf{Funding \& Talent:} Focuses on sustained investment, skills, and workforce readiness. 
		Mature organizations build structured programs for training, upskilling, and talent retention, 
		ensuring continuous innovation.
	\end{itemize}
	
\end{frame}

% Frame 2
\begin{frame}{Model Dimensions (2/2)}
	\vspace{20pt}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Data \& Infrastructure:} Examines data scope, platforms, architecture, and performance. 
		Early maturity shows siloed systems, while advanced levels adopt integrated, scalable, and secure 
		platforms such as warehouses, lakes, or lakehouses.
		
		\item \textbf{Analytics:} Reflects the breadth and depth of analytical capabilities, from basic 
		descriptive reports to predictive, prescriptive, and AI-driven insights. Mature organizations embed 
		analytics in operations and drive innovation through advanced AI and Generative AI.
		
		\item \textbf{Governance:} Includes data governance, AI governance, and supporting tools. 
		Covers compliance, risk management, stewardship, and ethical use, ensuring transparency, 
		trust, and accountability.
	\end{itemize}
	
	Understanding these five dimensions enables organizations to map their position 
	and set improvement priorities aligned with business context.
	
\end{frame}

\section{Maturity Stages}

% Frame 1
\begin{frame}{Maturity Stages (1/2)}
	\vspace{20pt}
	
	The TDWI BI \& AI maturity model describes five evolutionary stages.  
	Each stage reflects how organizations evolve in strategy, talent, data, analytics, and governance:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Nascent:} Reliance on manual reporting and fragmented spreadsheets.  
		No formal strategy, limited governance, and minimal leadership awareness of BI/AI value.  
		
		\item \textbf{Early:} Basic dashboards or initial data warehouses appear.  
		Analytics remain descriptive and departmental, with integration challenges and skills gaps.  
		
		\item \textbf{Established:} Broader BI adoption across functions.  
		Data integration improves via ETL or pipelines, governance becomes more structured, 
		and early predictive or ML experiments begin.  
	\end{enumerate}
	
\end{frame}

% Frame 2
\begin{frame}{Maturity Stages (2/2)}
	\vspace{20pt}
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\setcounter{enumi}{3} % continue numbering from 4
		\item \textbf{Mature:} Advanced analytics and AI are operationalized at scale.  
		MLOps practices support production AI, while governance ensures ethics, 
		security, and compliance. Data and AI drive enterprise-wide decision-making.  
		
		\item \textbf{Advanced / Visionary:} Organizations lead with Generative AI, 
		augmented analytics, and automation.  
		Data is monetized as a strategic asset, with BI/AI embedded in innovation 
		and business models, positioning them as industry leaders.  
	\end{enumerate}
	
	Maturity stages are evolutionary: strong foundations must be built before advancing.  
	Knowing the current stage enables organizations to design a clear and realistic roadmap.
